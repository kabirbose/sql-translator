# SQL Translator
A useful tool for people who don't enjoy chaining together large SQL queries. This app can connect directly to your PostgreSQL database and query it (eg. full CRUD). Except now, you don't need to write SQL, you can simply prompt it using English and AI does the rest.

# Note
This app works very well, however it only supports PostgreSQL databases at the moment. Also I'm around 90% done the UI/UX portion, however not it's fully complete yet.
